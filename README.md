# MyCart-Dev-Log
Welcome to the My Cart Dev Log! Here you can find a list of the proposed and implemented changes to the My Cart! app. We plan on updating this every time we push an update, have a list of proposed updates, or encounter an issue that might be affecting users across the app.

# What is My Cart?
My Cart! is our latest app that attempts to take grocery shopping and make it cheaper and easier. The app provides a fairly long list of groceries & recipes you can make along with price estimates from 5 major retailers including Walmart, Kroger, H-E-B, Aldi, and HyVee. We have plans to add more stores, recipes, and grocery items in the future!

Key features of the app:
- Shop groceries and recipes from 5 major retailers - Walmart, Kroger, Aldi, HEB, and HyVee. We also have plans to add more stores in 2024.
- Dozens of in-house recipes + thousands you can search up via 'generate' feature.
- Price comparisons of recipes/items by store.
- No added costs or surcharges (we don't add fees to the checkout price or take any %).
- Saving time from conventional in-store shopping - use Curbside pickup or delivery.
- Cheaper than other Meal-provider apps (Hello fresh, Factor, Uber Eats, etc).

The app is still a work in progress but it is available on both major app stores. Get it on
[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/my-cart/id6450795988) or 
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dxt.mealstogo)

# Want to help?
DxT LLC is a very small team of developers (some of whom work in their spare time) and your support would mean the world to us! Here's how you can help:
1. The easiest way to support us is to download the My Cart! app and become a premium member. It is $2.99 a month and we have a target goal of getting 1500+ MAUs by May of 2024.
2. Tell your friends! The easiest way to support our app is to grow it via word of mouth.
3. Download our other apps - we have an online multiplayer chess app (Chess with Friends!), a task management app (Tasker!, coming soon), a sudoku app, and many other apps that you can find by searching for DxT LLC on the Apple or Google Play App stores.
